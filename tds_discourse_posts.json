to use the token is given at\nGitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs\nYou cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt.

Use with care.\nKind regards\n\nbut the embedding model that is said to be used is text embedding 3 small, which is the model of OpenAI\n\nHi Nilay,\nYes you would need to use\ntext-embedding-3-small\nmodel of openai for embedding questions.\nKind regards\nJivraj\n\ni have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i  run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error,\nis there any solution to this problem?\n\nQ5.

With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.\n\nHi samra,\nTry installing some other browser see if that works.\n\nHi mishkat,\nWithout sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question."

I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.\nI have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:\n[Image: 1000042547] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/d/fd08e14665989ccea8f5a547b569521575208ae8_2_690x369.jpeg)\n1000042547\n1080×578 187 KB\nQuestion 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”\nTo filter such logs, we need:\nTime → for the hour and the day (Monday)\nMethod → to filter POST\nURL → to filter /images/\nSo, the correct minimal set is:\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nTime, Method, URL\nTime → needed\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nMethod → needed\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nURL → needed\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nReferer → not needed, but not harmful\nSo this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.\n[Image: 1000042548] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/0/9062a032d89a4b2b049ca34b23905d501cba7913_2_690x192.jpeg)\n1000042548\n1080×301 71.5 KB\nAcc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:\nStatus is numeric (200)\nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct\nAll required fields are present and properly formatted\nThe other options were as follows:\n9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)\n9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)\n9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827\n[Image: 1000042545] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/3/03aec49b7ba39078f204ef24fefa80dae8e9b373_2_690x299.jpeg)\n1000042545\n1079×468 35.7 KB\nCorrect Answer(s):\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nPUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nGET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nDELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).\nIncorrect Answer:\n[Image: :cross_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14)\nPOST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.\n(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)\nThank you",

    "full_text": "Hi\n@carlton\nand\n@Jivraj\nsir,\nI appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.\nI have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:\n[Image: 1000042547] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/d/fd08e14665989ccea8f5a547b569521575208ae8_2_690x369.jpeg)\n1000042547\n1080×578 187 KB\nQuestion 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”\nTo filter such logs, we need:\nTime → for the hour and the day (Monday)\nMethod → to filter POST\nURL → to filter /images/\nSo, the correct minimal set is:\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nTime, Method, URL\nTime → needed\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nMethod → needed\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nURL → needed\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nReferer → not needed, but not harmful\nSo this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.\n[Image: 1000042548] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/0/9062a032d89a4b2b049ca34b23905d501cba7913_2_690x192.jpeg)\n1000042548\n1080×301 71.5 KB\nAcc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:\nStatus is numeric (200)\nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct\nAll required fields are present and properly formatted\nThe other options were as follows:\n9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)\n9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)\n9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827\n[Image: 1000042545] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/3/03aec49b7ba39078f204ef24fefa80dae8e9b373_2_690x299.jpeg)\n1000042545\n1079×468 35.7 KB\nCorrect Answer(s):\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nPUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nGET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.\n[Image: :white_check_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14)\nDELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).\nIncorrect Answer:\n[Image: :cross_mark:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14)\nPOST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.\n(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)\nThank you\n\nAgree & second all thoughts shared by\n@24f2003130\nabove.\nI also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case\nlen(filtered entries)\nseems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ .\n[Image: image] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/5/f5f549e906df1006709b3257742fff4b52f416d0_2_690x245.png)\nimage\n1108×394 81.9 KB\nThe valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.\nAlso, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct.\nRequest you to please clarify and consider these points.\n\nYes\n@carlton\nthe wording of the question made it seem like the filters were already applied on the list\nfiltered_entries\n.\n\nClarifications on Queries\nWhich of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?\nDue to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response.\nHTTP method is idempotent\nThis question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent.\nEntries with 404 status code\nAlthough the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.\nWhich of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”?\nOption A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because:\nOption B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL\nOption C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page\nOption D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement\n\nThank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:\nRedundancy in Option A:\nThe Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.\nSimplicity in Filtering:\nFiltering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:\nTime → for checking the hour and weekday.\nMethod → to filter only POST.\nURL → to ensure the request is under /images/.\nThus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.\nConsistency with Log Parsing Practices:\nIn most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.\n\nSir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story. While all the other changes have been made with the same reflecting in the score, that question still says “The question and answer remain the same . No changes required”, which is different from your post.\n[Image: image] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/0/404e7b25f4155d41d4939b07fd45fa3c120beadd_2_690x31.png)\n[Image: image] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/1/91a843fad0075c603424114af0cfca114941a304_2_690x263.png)\nimage\n923×352 72 KB\nCan you please look into it?\nThanks\nRegards,\nShivaditya\n\n@iamprasna\nsir , the scores have been updated on the dashboard as well and the answer for the question in point 3 is still the same\nAdditionally , sir I have attached the snapshot of a dec’24 TDS PYQ which is a replica of this question and the answer for the same is mention the first option.\n[Image: 1000042796] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/d/fda110de0ada74e60ba0e160ab21463c4ebdbd44_2_690x343.jpeg)\n1000042796\n1080×538 84.7 KB\nThe link for the same has been attached for your referance\ndrive.google.com\nIIT M FOUNDATION DIPLOMA FN EXAM QDF2 22 Dec 2024.pdf\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nThat’s a great find.

You can then match the questions in order, even if the IDs don’t align exactly—it should still give you a general idea. From there, you can proceed accordingly.\n\n@iamprasna\n@carlton\nPlease look into it once. According to point 3 of\n@iamprasna\n’s post, I should get full credit for that question and it will take me to a perfect 100 score in ET from the current 97. I brought this into attention before the scores were pushed to the dashboard.\nRegards,\nShivaditya\n\nThe correction has been done to the following question for both the FN and AN sessions. You must be able to see the change in scores shortly\nEntries with 404 status code\nAlthough the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.\n\nThank you sir for acknowledging our requests and resolving the error"

How did we decide what to evaluate?\nAll the image ids we evaluated were what\nyou\nsubmitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by\n@s.anand\nas the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos\nyou\ngave us.\nFor clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.\nHow to fix bugs in our scripts\nCreate Pull requests to\nJivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1\n.\nDocker Image Architecture Issue Report\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\nSubmit Report\nBug fixes\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.\nKind regards,\nTDS Team\n\n\n\nWhat is the highest mark anyone has scored?

It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.\n\nYou have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.\n\nI have noticed that my image was run on a\nx86_64\narchitecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is\nARM\n. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the\nexec format error\n.\nThis was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.\n\nMy evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out.

I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\nThank you and Regards\nAkshit\n\nYes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.\nHowever, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.\nIs this information available to everyone\n@carlton\nsir?\n\nHello\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\n@s.anand\nsir,\nI hope you are doing well.\nAs per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.\nNow, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.\nWe sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.\nLooking forward to your kind consideration.\nBest regards,\nDigvijaysinh Chudasama\n\nThe Same happened to me.

Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.\nThank you for your support.\n\nYes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.\nFor instance:\nforecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.\nbut is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?\n\nLet’s wait for their response.\nI submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4\n\n@Jivraj\n@carlton\n@Saransh_Saini\nCan you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your problem).\nThanks\n\nHi\n@all\nQuestion intends you to select most correlated one.\nSelect option which is absolute highest.\n\n@Jivraj\n- Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices are matching with the answer.

If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.\n\nWell noted sir. Thanks a lot!\n\nSir, I received the mail today -\n[Image: image] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/d/ad119b889a66e6eab18abe54c39a127738d6aecc.png)\nimage\n652×156 5.43 KB\nSir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.\n[Image: image] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/2/4/249405cda01477954f6512c23abf1e0847f2f922_2_690x83.png)\nimage\n836×101 18.2 KB\nSir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided.\n[Image: image] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/7/47978e33c2430ea0e93f2b67507864bad6a01cd8.png)\nimage\n1113×487 20.2 KB\nSir can you please check.\nThankyou"

It would be great if you demonstrate it in today’s live session at 8pm. Otherwise next week is all about project 2 discussion.\n\nThank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my\nAzure API URL would be exposed\n, and since it incurs\ncosts per usage\n, I need to keep it secure.\nI’d prefer a\nprivate meet\nto demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!\n\nThat’s amazing\n@23f2005702\n,\nso far I have completed till 44 Qs and deployed it on azure too !! Mine is solving around 40 correctly out of these 44 (checked with another user’s login on the portal).\n\n@Saransh_Saini\nI can’t join the meet since I’m out of station and don’t have PC access. I also have other coursework, so I’ll be available for a meet from the 31st onwards\n\nCongrats for your project mate!\nJust wanted to ask how did you frame your questions for the Graded Assignments? Cause that will help me complete mine.\nThanks in advance"

        "text": "@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\nDear TDS Team,\nI hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved:\nWhile doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread .

The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.\nAfter the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).\nTo check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.\ninputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')\ntextboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\")\nbuttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\")\ninputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\nbuttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\ntextboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\nDo not submit or save your answers.\nAll the best!\nKind regards\nTDS Team\nUpdate 2\n26/02/2025 11:00 am\nWe will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).\nThe link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal.

Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.\nThe form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.\nWe have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.\nWe will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.\nAll the best!\n\n\n\nShould we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ?\n\nFrom where can I get today’s live sessions link\n\neither is fine.

    "full_text": "Dear\n@jkmadathil\n@Anand\n@Bharathi\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the\nTDS team\nin supporting us throughout this course. The\nlive sessions and guidance\nhave been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\n[Image: :small_blue_diamond:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12)\nLack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any\nprerequisites\n, leading many students—including those from\nnon-technical backgrounds\n—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the\ncourse content, assignments, and projects\nhave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n[Image: :small_blue_diamond:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12)\nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe\ndifficulty of the projects\nhas been overwhelming, requiring most of us to\nrely heavily on peer support\njust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n[Image: :small_blue_diamond:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12)\nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined\nTDS\nbased on past\nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for\nworking professionals\nand students without prior experience.\n[Image: :small_blue_diamond:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12)\nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending\n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\nto secure good scores—we still find ourselves\nstruggling to meet expectations\nfor the\nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\n\nYes sir please look into this\n\n@Anand\n@Bharathi\nYes ma’am please pay attention to our concern.\n\nYes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course. Please consider this request.\n@carlton\n,\n@Saransh_Saini\n,\n@Jivraj\n,\n@Anand\n\nYes\n@s.anand\nsir\n@jkmadathil\nsir\n@Bharathi\nMam,\nPlss look into this as this is becoming too too hectic ans stressful now Mam.\n\nRight,\nI put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.\nI tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.\nI completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.\n\nHi\n@s.anand\n@jkmadathil\n@Bharathi\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nCould you please look into the above issue?\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\nGrading Concerns\nFinal Course Score:\nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F\n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:\nWhat’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?\n.\nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (\ndeadline: 16th Feb 2025\n), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\nMany students pursuing this course are\ndual-degree students or working professionals\n, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe\nlast-minute guidance\nfor projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe\nstructuring and scheduling of sessions\nfeel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2\n, well in advance of the deadline.\nMore structured and accessible support\n, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels\n, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.\n\nPlease look into it sir.\n\nThank you\n@A_LAKSHMI\nfor the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the\ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this\nDiscourse thread\nwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the\nfirst page of the TDS course\nGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\nThis course is quite hard\nHere’s students’ feedback:\nIt\nused\nto be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n#\n#\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n#\nThe ROE is hard.\n#\nTake Graded assignment 1\nto check if you’re ready for this course.\nPlease drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -\nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you’ve learnt.\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a\nnice blog\nwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -\nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\nThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n@22f2001640\nManagement of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.\n\nRegarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\nWhile grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.\n\nNicely highlighted the concern of all students.\nTDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background.\nIITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis.\n\nDam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B\n[Image: :sweat_smile:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12)\n) I’m still getting dragged into this\n[Image: :laughing:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/laughing.png?v=12)\n[Image: :rofl:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/rofl.png?v=12)\n…\n\nBut still this is a huge Problem …\n[Image: :expressionless:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/expressionless.png?v=12)\n[Image: ] (https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/48/100121_2.png)\njkmadathil:\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n#\n\nGreat! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too.\n\nTruly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!\n\nSeeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult.\n\nYou will survive. Just watch tonight’s session.\n[Image: :slight_smile:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12)\nand prepare and practise."

Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project.\nLooking forward to your reply.\nThank you\nSatvik Sawhney\n23f2003680\n\nSo the reason for the failure is:\nYou had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)\nThen when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.\nThen once you realised your mistake, on\nFeb 17th at 9:11 pm IST\ni.e\nyesteday\n, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.\nThen you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]\n[Image: image] (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/a/6a4a28aa638840e8d2e4dbf246ca235fd41e5ccb.png)\nimage\n250×534 3.92 KB\n[/quote]\nshowing that your files are in the correct place.\nWe do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.\nKind regards\n\n@carlton\nsir\nYes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.\nI understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered\n[Image: :frowning:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/frowning.png?v=12)\nKind regards,\nArnav Mehta\n21f3002647\n\nSir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.\nSir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted.

Some days extension might reduce our stress and we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us.\n\n@carlton\n@s.anand\nsir pls extend the deadline as the GATE DA exam is also scheduled on Saturday\n\nPlease extend the deadline\n[Image: :pray:t2:] (https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/pray/2.png?v=12)\n\n@s.anand\n@carlton\nsir pls extend the deadline of project1 as it’s very difficult,  we are spending so much of time still not able to complete the project and the gate exam is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the deadline could be extended…\n\nPlease at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension.\n\nKindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission.\n@carlton\n@s.anand\n\nIndeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them.\nEXTEND !!!\n\nKindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as many students have their GATE exam on Saturday.

The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\nIsolation\n– Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\nReproducibility\n– A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\nPortability\n– You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\nUsing requirements.txt\n• Best for\nreproducibility\nand\ncollaboration\nsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you\ndon’t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you\ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a\nrequirements.txt\nfile for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\nKind regards\n\nFor some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n[Image: ] (https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/24f2006531/48/111700_2.png)\n24f2006531:\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\nComing to your second question,\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n[Image: ] (https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/24f2006531/48/111700_2.png)\n24f2006531:\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that,\npip3 freeze > requirements.txt\n. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\n\nThank you sir for clarifying.\n[Image: ] (https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/48/56317_2.png)\ncarlton:\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\nI wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question."
